# Building a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Rails

## What are Progressive Web Apps?
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine the best of web and mobile apps, offering features like offline access, push notifications, and a native app-like experience.

As defined by [web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/what-are-pwas) they are built and enhanced with modern APIs to provide enhanced capabilities while still reaching any web user on any device with a single codebase.

## Core Progressive Web App checklist
The Progressive Web App Checklist describes what makes an app installable and usable by all users, regardless of size or input type.
 - Starts fast, stays fast
 - Works in any browser
 - Responsive to any screen size
 - Provides a custom offline page
 - Is installable
